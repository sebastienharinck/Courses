# Courses
## Introduction
Repository with all courses about artificial intelligence I have finished or I am doing right now.
They concerned :
- python
- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
- pandas
- scrapy
- matplotlib
- mathematics stuff


## All courses
- Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow

## Links
I try to put here all available ressources on internet that I found useful.
